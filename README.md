# BugStrike-project

Certainly! Below are the installation and deployment instructions for the simple smart contract vulnerability scanner:

Installation and Deployment Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm:

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from Node.js official website.
Ethereum Node:

You‚Äôll need access to an Ethereum node (either a local node or a remote one). You can use services like Infura or run your own Ethereum node.
Solidity Compiler (solc):

Install the Solidity compiler (solc) globally using npm:
npm install -g solc

Steps
Clone the Repository:

Clone the repository containing the smart contract scanner code:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vulnerability-scanner.git
cd vulnerability-scanner

Install Dependencies:

Install the required Node.js dependencies:
npm install

Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the project root directory.
Add the following environment variables:
ETHEREUM_NODE_URL=<your_ethereum_node_url>
OWNER_ADDRESS=<your_owner_address>

Compile the Smart Contract:

Compile the VulnerabilityScanner.sol contract using the Solidity compiler:
solc --bin --abi contracts/VulnerabilityScanner.sol -o build/

Deploy the Smart Contract:

Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum network of your choice (e.g., Ropsten, Rinkeby, or Mainnet).
Record the deployed contract address.
Update Contract Address:

In the scanner.js file, replace YOUR_VULNERABILITY_SCANNER_ADDRESS with the actual deployed contract address.
Run the Scanner:

Execute the scanner script:
node scanner.js

This will scan the target contract (replace 0x... with the actual target contract address).
Usage
Deploy the VulnerabilityScanner contract to the Ethereum network.
Use the scanContract function to scan other contracts for vulnerabilities.
Adjust the vulnerability checks in the Solidity contract as needed.
Remember to handle your private keys securely and follow best practices for deploying smart contracts. Happy scanning! üõ°Ô∏è
